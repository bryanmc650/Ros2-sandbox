# Sensor Fusion Sandbox

This is a self-directed engineering project to explore and implement key components of autonomous systems using ROS 2 and C++. It includes working modules for sensor simulation, Kalman filtering, and placeholders for future path planning and control algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Refresh and apply core concepts in:
  - Sensor fusion (Kalman Filter, EKF)
  - State estimation from noisy data
  - Path planning (A*, RRT)
  - Control systems (PID, LQR, MPC)
- Build a clean, modular, and expandable ROS 2 workspace
- Simulate sensor data and implement fusing algorithms in C++
- Lay the groundwork for deploying algorithms on a physical robot or drone

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ sensor_sim/ # Simulates IMU and GPS data (with noise)
â”œâ”€â”€ sensor_fusion_core/ # Implements Kalman Filter for position and velocity estimation
â”œâ”€â”€ path_planner/ # (Placeholder) For future A* or sampling-based planners
â””â”€â”€ controller_core/ # (Placeholder) For future PID, LQR, or MPC controllers


## âœ… Current Status

- [x] ROS 2 workspace set up and running under WSL
- [x] Simulated IMU and GPS publishers
- [x] Subscribed fusion node logging received messages
- [ ] Kalman Filter implementation in progress
- [ ] Logging and plotting of results
- [ ] Real-time visualization and Gazebo integration

## ðŸ§ª How to Build and Run

```bash
# Source ROS and build the workspace
cd ~/Projects/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

# Run sensor simulation
ros2 run sensor_sim sensor_sim

# In a second terminal
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/Projects/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run sensor_fusion_core sensor_fusion_core

ðŸ“ˆ Roadmap
Implement 1D Kalman Filter with IMU acceleration and GPS position
Output state estimation and compare to ground truth
Add velocity simulation and CSV logging
Extend to 2D fusion (x, y position)
Introduce simple A* path planner
Build PID and LQR controllers
Integrate with a small physical robot or drone
Add Gazebo simulation with sensor plugins
